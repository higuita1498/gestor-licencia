# Gestor de licencias

This is a project based on the creation and management of licenses.

## Getting started

### Launch the starter project

*(Assuming you've [installed Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x))*

Fork this repository, then clone your fork, and run this in your newly created directory:

``` bash
composer install
```

Next you need to make a copy of the `.env.example` file and rename it to `.env` inside your project root.

Run the following command to generate your app key:

```
php artisan key:generate
```

Then start your server:

```
php artisan serve
```

Next config your database and use:
```
php artisan migrate
```

now you can compile the assets:
```
npm install && npm run dev
```

Your Laravel starter project is now up and running!
